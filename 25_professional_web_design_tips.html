						<p>25  Professional Web Design Tips
                            1.     The five Second Rule
                            
                            Remember that you simply} have just 5 seconds to elucidate your worth proposition to users once they enter to your web site. the rear button is that the most generally used command on the net. If you don’t answer a user’s wants promptly, he or she’s going to click “back” and exit your web site. confirm your web site options compelling copy that attracts readers in and provides them reasons to remain.
                            
                             
                            
                            
                            2. correct electronic communication
                            
                            The most vital side of a web site is its electronic communication. the foremost effective sites feature clear, concise, bit text electronic communication in no over a couple of words. don’t place long paragraphs on your homepage. Your homepage could be a entry into your web site. Use short electronic communication that gets to the purpose.
                            
                             
                            
                            
                            3. decision to Action

Calls to action ought to be within the prime masthead space and body of a web site (above the “fold” that needs the viewer to scroll). If your page is long enough, having another CTA on the lowest of your page is useful still.
                            
                            4. Building Trust

                            7. Don’t Make Me Think
