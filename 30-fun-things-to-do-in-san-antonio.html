						<h2>Why do businesses hire professional web designers ?
                        </h2>
						<p>There are so many ways to advertise your company and say what you need to say.
<!-- Throw in some &nbsp-->
                        This can make it really confusing for a new business owner. You are probably wondering why should we invest hundreds of dollars for a website, or why invest for website hosting, or why pay for marketing when you can just make some signs or go on craigslist.
                            
                            Well, here’s the truth; a developer understands that to convert visitors into buyers requires more than just a website. You need to know how to make your website actually look like a “real company website”. There are ton’s and ton’s of small business & medium business websites all over the internet that just look so horrible! I recently, saw a competitors site that looked so so bad. I had no idea how they were still in business! Their website didn’t have
                            
                            more than two colors.  There was  no links to social media on their website, they didn’t update their site so that scrapers would not call them but only real customers would call them. It was just a mess. After seeing all of this I took a few minutes to research their company. They were in business for over 20 years, So I am pretty sure they just weren’t up to date. I get it technology is a very fast paced field. All this means is that you simply have to keep up.  The really messed up thing is we see this all the time! We see other web developers who aren’t using social media properly, they aren’t getting in touch with their customers, they don’t have an email list for re-targeting, their seo is not coded properly , etc. etc.
                            
                            See the thing about web Design or web development is that you really really have to hone your craft. You have to do your marketing and you have to know what is in. Even seasoned developers often have a problem doing this. I saw a website the other day from another seasoned web development company. For some odd
                            
                            reason they did not even have a 100 followers on their main social media account. It was horrible. I see things like this and I wonder if they’re masochists! I mean you kind of have to be right?  they are only hurting themselves.
                            
                            so now you are probably wondering what all of this has to do with you and your company. Well, the truth is if our seasoned competitors are messing up on the basics than well, you really
                            
                            should hire us! With all the things we have seen in the past 4 years alone, we can guarantee that you will be so much better off just hiring our firm to create your website and market for you! We believe in our product and we have no problem knowing that our phones are ringing off the hook!! We want the same for you too!</p>
